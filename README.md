# The Graph Epochs

This is a NextJS React app interview challenge. Please fork this repo, and push your code to a branch in your forked repo (following the instructions below).

In this exercise you will create a page that lists all projects (as cards), and when clicking on the individual project card, it will take a user to a new page, which has more details about the project.

Designs can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/x6f8HRP0TH0uWIWYqHfEup/Product-coding-challenge).

1. React Query is already setup and we use it to fetch data for both pages.
2. On the Projects page - show the list of projects as cards. Make sure to implement the hover state, and to make the layout responsive.  
3. On the individual Project page - show more details about the project itself. The data should be already available for that page. Remember to have the hover state for the button. Button click shouldn't do anything.

# Notes

- Make sure to implement the UI/UX according to the Designs provided. We highly value attention to detail.
- For styling we use Theme UI. There is an example in the app of how to add styles.
